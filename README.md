The game Pong is implemented in Unity in several versions building on each other:

* The first version runs on one computer with one player controlling a paddle with the w/s keys, the other player the other paddle with up/down keys.

`git checkout v1-simple`

* The scond version is a simple network game using an ip address. One player starts as host, the other enters as client. Controls are up/down keys.

`git checkout v2-simple-network`
