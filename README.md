The game Pong is implemented in Unity in several versions building on each other:

* The first version runs on one computer with one player controlling a paddle with the w/s keys, the other player the other paddle with up/down keys.

`git checkout v1-simple`

* The second version is a simple network game using an ip address. One player starts as host, the other enters as client. Controls are up/down keys.

`git checkout v2-simple-network`

* The third version is the network g of v2 but with a small menu to set the speed of the ball and the number or rounds to win.

`git checkout v3-simple-network-prefs`

* The fourth version uses distributed authority instead of client-server.

`git checkout v4-distributed-authority`
